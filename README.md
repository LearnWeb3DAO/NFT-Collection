# NFT-Collection

Now its time for you to launch your NFT collection - `Crypto Devs`.

---

## Requirements

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- Whitelisted users, should have have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guranteed 1 NFT per transaction.
- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.

Lets start building ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

- You can have completed the [Whitelist dApp tutorial](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp)

---

## Build

### Smart Contract

First before we start building you would need to understand what an ERC721 is and why is it used for creating NFT's. You can find the entire explanation for ERC721 [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Make sure you read the provided link before you proceed to next steps.

To build the smart contract we would be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

- To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

  ```bash
  mkdir hardhat-tutorial
  cd hardhat-tutorial
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```

  In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat
  ```

  and press `enter` for all the questions.

- In the same terminal now install `@openzeppelin/contracts` as we would be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC721 Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) in our `CryptoDevs` contract

  ```bash
  npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
  ```

- We will need to call the `Whitelist Contract` that you deployed for your previous level to check for addresses that were whitelisted and give them presale access. As we only need to call `mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;` We can create an interface for `Whitelist contract` with a function only for this mapping, this way we would save `gas` as we would not need to inherit and deploy the entire `Whitelist Contract` but only a part of it.

- Create a new file inside the `contracts` direactory and call it `IWhitelist.sol`

  ```go
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  interface IWhitelist {
      function whitelistedAddresses(address) external view returns (bool);
  }
  ```

- Create a new file inside the `contracts` directory called `CryptoDevs.sol`.

  ```go
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
  import "./IWhitelist.sol";

  contract CryptoDevs is ERC721, Ownable {
      /**
      * @dev _baseTokenURI for computing {tokenURI}. If set, the resulting URI for each
      * token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `tokenId`.
      */
      string _baseTokenURI;

    //  _price is the price of one Crypto Dev NFT
    uint256 public _price = 0.01 ether;

    // _paused is used to pause the contract in case of an emergency
    bool public _paused;

    // max number of CryptoDevs
    uint256 public maxTokenIds = 20;

    // total number of tokenIds minted
    uint256 public tokenIds;

    // Whitelist contract instance
    IWhitelist whitelist;

    // boolean to keep track of when presale started
    bool presaleStarted;

    // timestamp for even presale would end
    uint256 presaleEnded;

    modifier onlyWhenNotPaused {
        require(!_paused, "Contract currently paused");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev ERC721 constructor takes in a `name` and a `symbol` to the token collection.
     * name in our case is `Crypto Devs` and symbol is `CD`.
     * Constructor for Crypto Devs takes in the baseURI to set _baseTokenURI for the collection.
     * It also initializes an instance of whitelist interface.
     */
    constructor (string memory baseURI, address whitelistContract) ERC721("Crypto Devs", "CD") {
        _baseTokenURI = baseURI;
        whitelist = IWhitelist(whitelistContract);
    }

    /**
    * @dev startPresale starts a presale for the whitelisted addresses
     */
    function startPresale() public onlyOwner {
        presaleStarted = true;
        // Set presaleEnded time as current timestamp + 5 minutes
        // Solidity has cool syntax for timestamps (seconds, minutes, hours, days, years)
        presaleEnded = block.timestamp + 5 minutes;
    }

    /**
     * @dev presaleMint allows an user to mint one NFT per transaction during the presale.
     */
    function presaleMint() public payable onlyWhenNotPaused {
        require(presaleStarted && block.timestamp < presaleEnded, "Presale is not running");
        require(whitelist.whitelistedAddresses(msg.sender), "You are not whitelisted");
        require(tokenIds < maxTokenIds, "Exceeded maximum Cypto Devs supply");
        require(msg.value >= _price, "Ether sent is not correct");
        tokenIds += 1;
        //_safeMint is a safer version of the _mint function as it ensures that
        // if the address being minted to is a contract, then it knows how to deal with ERC721 tokens
        // If the address being minted to is not a contract, it works the same way as _mint
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenIds);
    }

    /**
    * @dev mint allows an user to mint 1 NFT per transaction after the presale has ended.
    */
    function mint() public payable onlyWhenNotPaused {
        require(presaleStarted && block.timestamp >=  presaleEnded, "Presale has not ended yet");
        require(tokenIds < maxTokenIds, "Exceed maximum Cypto Devs supply");
        require(msg.value >= _price, "Ether sent is not correct");
        tokenIds += 1;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenIds);
    }

    /**
    * @dev _baseURI overides the Openzeppelin's ERC721 implementation which by default
    * returned an empty string for the baseURI
    */
    function _baseURI() internal view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return _baseTokenURI;
    }

    /**
    * @dev setPaused makes the contract paused or unpaused
     */
    function setPaused(bool val) public onlyOwner {
        _paused = val;
    }

    /**
    * @dev withdraw sends all the ether in the contract
    * to the owner of the contract
     */
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner  {
        address _owner = owner();
        uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
        (bool sent, ) =  _owner.call{value: amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

     // Function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
    receive() external payable {}

    // Fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
    fallback() external payable {}
  }
  ```

- Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

```bash
   npx hardhat compile
```

- Now we would install `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
  npm install dotenv
  ```

- Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines, use the instructions in the comments to get your Alchemy API Key URL and RINKEBY Private Key. Make sure that the account from which you get your rinkeby private key is funded with Rinkeby Ether.

```

// Go to https://www.alchemyapi.io, sign up, create
// a new App in its dashboard and select the network as Rinkeby, and replace "add-the-alchemy-key-url-here" with its key url
ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL="add-the-alchemy-key-url-here"

// Replace this private key with your RINKEBY account private key
// To export your private key from Metamask, open Metamask and
// go to Account Details > Export Private Key
// Be aware of NEVER putting real Ether into testing accounts
RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-rinkeby-private-key-here"

// Address of the Whitelist Contract that you deployed
WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="address-of-the-whitelist-contract"
```

- Lets deploy the contract to `rinkeby` network.Create a new file named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder

- Now we would write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

  ```js
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
  require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

  async function main() {
    const whitelistContract = process.env.WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
    /*
    A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
    so cryptoDevsContract here is a factory for instances of our CryptoDevs contract.
  */
    const cryptoDevsContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("CryptoDevs");

    // here we deploy the contract
    const deployedCryptoDevsContract = await cryptoDevsContract.deploy(
      "https://cryptodevs.vercel.app/api/metadata/",
      whitelistContract
    );

    // print the address of the deployed contract
    console.log(
      "Crypto Devs Contract Address:",
      deployedCryptoDevsContract.address
    );
  }

  // Call the main function and catch if there is any error
  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```

- Now open the hardhat.config.js file, we would add the `rinkeby` network here so that we can deploy our contract to rinkeby. Replace all the lines in the `hardhart.config.js` file with the given below lines

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL = process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL;

const RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL,
      accounts: [RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

- To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command
  ```bash
      npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
  ```
- Save the Crypto Devs Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it futher down in the tutorial.

### Website

- To develop the website we would be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.
- First, You would need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

  ```
     - Crypto-Devs-Dapp
         - hardhat-tutorial
         - next-app
  ```

- To create this `next-app`, in the terminal point to Whitelist-Dapp folder and type

  ```bash
      npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

  and press `enter` for all the questions

- Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

  ```
  cd my-app
  npm run dev
  ```

- Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

- Now lets install Web3Modal library(https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc), You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
  Open up a terminal pointing at`my-app` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npm install web3modal
```

- In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

```bash
npm i ethers
```

- In your public folder, download this file [SVG](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp/blob/main/my-app/public/crypto-devs.svg) and rename it to `crypto-devs.svg`
- Now go to styles folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

  ```css
  .main {
    min-height: 90vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  }

  .footer {
    display: flex;
    padding: 2rem 0;
    border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .image {
    width: 70%;
    height: 50%;
    margin-left: 20%;
  }

  .title {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin: 2rem 0;
  }

  .description {
    line-height: 1;
    margin: 2rem 0;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }

  .button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: blue;
    border: none;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-size: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-bottom: 2%;
  }
  @media (max-width: 1000px) {
    .main {
      width: 100%;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }
  }
  ```

- Open you index.js file under the pages folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

  ```js
  import Head from "next/head";
  import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";
  import Web3Modal from "web3modal";

        </footer>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

- Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`.
- In the constants folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code. Replace `"addres of your whitelist contract"` with the address of the whitelist contract that you deployed. Replace `---your abi---` with the abi of your Whitelist Contract. To get the abi for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/Whitelist.sol` folder and from your `Whitelist.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.

```js
export const abi =---your abi---
export const WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "addres of your whitelist contract"
```

- Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your whitelist dapp should now work without errors ðŸš€
