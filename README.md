# NFT-Collection

Now its time for you to launch your own NFT collection - `Crypto Devs`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fVxV66f.png)

## Requirements

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- Whitelisted users, should have a 5 min presale period before the actual sale where they are guaranteed 1 NFT per transaction.
- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.

Lets start building ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

- You should have completed the [Whitelist dApp tutorial](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Whitelist-Dapp)

## Theory

- What is a Non-Fungible Token?
  Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable eg Eth is fungible. With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable eg Unique Art

- What is ERC-721?
  ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs. Before moving ahead have a look at all the functions supported by [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721)

### Smart Contract

- We would also be using [`Ownable.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) from Openzeppelin which helps you manage the `Ownership` of a contract

  - By default, the owner of an Ownable contract is the account that deployed it, which is usually exactly what you want.
  - Ownable also lets you:
    - transferOwnership from the owner account to a new one, and
    - renounceOwnership for the owner to relinquish this administrative privilege, a common pattern after an initial stage with centralized administration is over.

- We would also be using an extension of ERC721 known as [ERC721 Enumerable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol)
  - ERC721 Enumerable is helps you to keep track of all the tokenIds in the contract and also the tokensIds held by an address for a given contract.
  - Please have a look at the [functions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Enumerable) it implements before moving ahead

To build the smart contract we would be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

- To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

  ```bash
  mkdir hardhat-tutorial
  cd hardhat-tutorial
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```
- In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat
  ```

  - Select `Create a basic sample project`
  - Press enter for the already specified `Hardhat Project root`
  - Press enter for the question on if you want to add a `.gitignore`
  - Press enter for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers)?`

Now you have a hardhat project ready to go!

If you are not on mac, please do this extra step and install these libraries as well :)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

  and press `enter` for all the questions.

- In the same terminal now install `@openzeppelin/contracts` as we would be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC721Enumerable Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol) in our `CryptoDevs` contract.

  ```bash
  npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
  ```

- We will need to call the `Whitelist Contract` that you deployed for your previous level to check for addresses that were whitelisted and give them presale access. As we only need to call `mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;` We can create an interface for `Whitelist contract` with a function only for this mapping, this way we would save `gas` as we would not need to inherit and deploy the entire `Whitelist Contract` but only a part of it.

- Create a new file inside the `contracts` directory and call it `IWhitelist.sol`

  ```go
      // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
      pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

      interface IWhitelist {
          function whitelistedAddresses(address) external view returns (bool);
      }
  ```

- Now lets create a new file inside the `contracts` directory and call it `CryptoDevs.sol`

  ```go
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
    import "./IWhitelist.sol";

    contract CryptoDevs is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable {
        /**
         * @dev _baseTokenURI for computing {tokenURI}. If set, the resulting URI for each
         * token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `tokenId`.
         */
        string _baseTokenURI;

        //  _price is the price of one Crypto Dev NFT
        uint256 public _price = 0.01 ether;

        // _paused is used to pause the contract in case of an emergency
        bool public _paused;

        // max number of CryptoDevs
        uint256 public maxTokenIds = 20;

        // total number of tokenIds minted
        uint256 public tokenIds;

        // Whitelist contract instance
        IWhitelist whitelist;

        // boolean to keep track of whether presale started or not
        bool public presaleStarted;

        // timestamp for when presale would end
        uint256 public presaleEnded;

        modifier onlyWhenNotPaused {
            require(!_paused, "Contract currently paused");
            _;
        }

        /**

         * name in our case is `Crypto Devs` and symbol is `CD`.
         * Constructor for Crypto Devs takes in the baseURI to set _baseTokenURI for the collection.
         * It also initializes an instance of whitelist interface.
         */
        constructor (string memory baseURI, address whitelistContract) ERC721("Crypto Devs", "CD") {
            _baseTokenURI = baseURI;
            whitelist = IWhitelist(whitelistContract);
        }

        /**
        * @dev startPresale starts a presale for the whitelisted addresses
         */
        function startPresale() public onlyOwner {
            presaleStarted = true;
            // Set presaleEnded time as current timestamp + 5 minutes
            // Solidity has cool syntax for timestamps (seconds, minutes, hours, days, years)
            presaleEnded = block.timestamp + 5 minutes;
        }

        /**
         * @dev presaleMint allows a user to mint one NFT per transaction during the presale.
         */
        function presaleMint() public payable onlyWhenNotPaused {
            require(presaleStarted && block.timestamp < presaleEnded, "Presale is not running");
            require(whitelist.whitelistedAddresses(msg.sender), "You are not whitelisted");
            require(tokenIds < maxTokenIds, "Exceeded maximum Crypto Devs supply");
            require(msg.value >= _price, "Ether sent is not correct");
            tokenIds += 1;
            //_safeMint is a safer version of the _mint function as it ensures that
            // if the address being minted to is a contract, then it knows how to deal with ERC721 tokens
            // If the address being minted to is not a contract, it works the same way as _mint
            _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenIds);
        }

        /**
        * @dev mint allows a user to mint 1 NFT per transaction after the presale has ended.
        */
        function mint() public payable onlyWhenNotPaused {
            require(presaleStarted && block.timestamp >=  presaleEnded, "Presale has not ended yet");
            require(tokenIds < maxTokenIds, "Exceed maximum Crypto Devs supply");
            require(msg.value >= _price, "Ether sent is not correct");
            tokenIds += 1;
            _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenIds);
        }

        /**

        function _baseURI() internal view virtual override returns (string memory) {
            return _baseTokenURI;
        }

        /**

        function setPaused(bool val) public onlyOwner {
            _paused = val;
        }

        /**

        function withdraw() public onlyOwner  {
            address _owner = owner();
            uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
            (bool sent, ) =  _owner.call{value: amount}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        }

         // Function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
        receive() external payable {}

        // Fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
        fallback() external payable {}
    }
  ```
- Now we would install `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
  npm install dotenv
  ```

- Now create a `.env` file in the `hardhat-tutorial` folder and add the following lines, use the instructions in the comments to get your Alchemy API Key URL and RINKEBY Private Key. Make sure that the account from which you get your rinkeby private key is funded with Rinkeby Ether.

  ```bash
  // Go to https://www.alchemyapi.io, sign up, create
  // a new App in its dashboard and select the network as Rinkeby, and replace "add-the-alchemy-key-url-here" with its key url
  ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL="add-the-alchemy-key-url-here"

  // Replace this private key with your RINKEBY account private key
  // To export your private key from Metamask, open Metamask and
  // go to Account Details > Export Private Key
  // Be aware of NEVER putting real Ether into testing accounts
  RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-rinkeby-private-key-here"
  ```

- Lets deploy the contract to `rinkeby` network. Create a new file named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder

- Now we would write some code to deploy the contract in `deploy.js` file.

  ```js
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
  require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
  const { WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, METADATA_URL } = require("../constants");

  async function main() {
    // Address of the whitelist contract that you deployed in the previous module
    const whitelistContract = WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
    // URL from where we can extract the metadata for a Crypto Dev NFT
    const metadataURL = METADATA_URL;
    /*
    A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
    so cryptoDevsContract here is a factory for instances of our CryptoDevs contract.
    */
    const cryptoDevsContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("CryptoDevs");

    // deploy the contract
    const deployedCryptoDevsContract = await cryptoDevsContract.deploy(
      metadataURL,
      whitelistContract
    );

    // print the address of the deployed contract
    console.log(
      "Crypto Devs Contract Address:",
      deployedCryptoDevsContract.address
    );
  }

  // Call the main function and catch if there is any error
  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```

- As you can read, `deploy.js` requires some constants. Lets create a folder named `constants` under the `hardhat-tutorial` folder
- Now add an `index.js` file inside the `constants` folder and add the following lines to the file. Replace "address-of-the-whitelist-contract" with the address of the whitelist contract that you deployed in the previous tutorial. For Metadata_URL, just copy the sample one that has been provided. We would replace this further down in the tutorial.

  ```js
  // Address of the Whitelist Contract that you deployed
  const WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address-of-the-whitelist-contract";
  // URL to extract Metadata for a Crypto Dev NFT
  const METADATA_URL = "https://nft-collection-sneh1999.vercel.app/api/";

  module.exports = { WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, METADATA_URL };
  ```

- Now open the hardhat.config.js file, we would add the `rinkeby` network here so that we can deploy our contract to rinkeby. Replace all the lines in the `hardhart.config.js` file with the given below lines

  ```js
  require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
  require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

  const ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL = process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL;

  const RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY;

  module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.4",
    networks: {
      rinkeby: {
        url: ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL,
        accounts: [RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY],
      },
    },
  };
  ```
  
- Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
  ```
  
- To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at`hardhat-tutorial` directory and execute this command
  ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
  ```
- Save the Crypto Devs Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it futher down in the tutorial.

### Website

- To develop the website we would be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.
- First, You would need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

  ```
     - NFT-Collection
         - hardhat-tutorial
         - my-app
  ```

- To create this `my-app`, in the terminal point to NFT-Collection folder and type

  ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

  and press `enter` for all the questions

- Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

  ```
  cd my-app
  npm run dev
  ```

- Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

- Now lets install Web3Modal library(https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc), You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
  Open up a terminal pointing at`my-app` directory and execute this command

  ```bash
    npm install web3modal
  ```

- In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

  ```bash
  npm install ethers
  ```

- In your public folder, download this folder and all the images in it (https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/NFT-Collection/tree/main/my-app/public/cryptodevs). Make sure that the name of the downloaded folder is `cryptodevs`

- Now go to styles folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

  ```css
  .main {
    min-height: 90vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  }

  .footer {
    display: flex;
    padding: 2rem 0;
    border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .image {
    width: 70%;
    height: 50%;
    margin-left: 20%;
  }

  .title {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin: 2rem 0;
  }

  .description {
    line-height: 1;
    margin: 2rem 0;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }

  .button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: blue;
    border: none;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-size: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-bottom: 2%;
  }
  @media (max-width: 1000px) {
    .main {
      width: 100%;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }
  }
  ```

- Open you index.js file under the pages folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

  ```js
  import { Contract, providers, utils } from "ethers";
  import Head from "next/head";
  import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
  import Web3Modal from "web3modal";
  import { abi, NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from "../constants";

    const [presaleStarted, setPresaleStarted] = useState(false);
    // presaleEnded keeps track of whether the presale ended
    const [presaleEnded, setPresaleEnded] = useState(false);
    // loading is set to true when we are waiting for a transaction to get mined
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
    // checks if the currently connected MetaMask wallet is the owner of the contract
    const [isOwner, setIsOwner] = useState(false);
    // tokenIdsMinted keeps track of the number of tokenIds that have been minted
    const [tokenIdsMinted, setTokenIdsMinted] = useState("0");
    // Create a reference to the Web3 Modal (used for connecting to Metamask) which persists as long as the page is open
    const web3ModalRef = useRef();

- Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`.
- In the constants folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code.

  - Replace `"addres of your NFT contract"` with the address of the CryptoDevs contract that you deployed and saved to your notepad.
  - Replace `---your abi---` with the abi of your CryptoDevs Contract. To get the abi for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/CryptoDevs.sol` folder and from your `CryptoDevs.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.

  ```js
  export const abi =---your abi---
  export const NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address of your NFT contract"
  ```

- Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

Your Crypto Devs NFT dapp should now work without errors ðŸš€

### Push to github

Make sure before proceeding you have [pushed all your code to github](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-gentle-introduction-to-git-and-github-the-eli5-way-43f0aa64f2e4) :)

---

## Deploying your dApp

We will now deploy your dApp, so that everyone can see your website and you can share it with all of your LearnWeb3 DAO friends.

- Go to https://vercel.com/ and sign in with your GitHub
- Then click on `New Project` button and then select your NFT-Collection repo
- When configuring your new project, Vercel will allow you to customize your `Root Directory`
- Click `Edit` next to `Root Directory` and set it to `my-app`
- Select the Framework as `Next.js`
- Click `Deploy`
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/oaEt3Tj.png)

- Now you can see your deployed website by going to your dashboard, selecting your project, and copying the `domain` from there! Save the `domain` on notepad, you would need it later.

## View your Collection on Opensea

Now lets make your collection is available on Opensea

To make the collection available on Opensea, we would need to create a metadata endpoint. This endpoint would return the metadata for an NFT given its `tokenId`.

- Open your `my-app` folder and under`pages/api` folder, create a new file named `[tokenId].js`(Make sure the name has the brackets as well). Adding the brackets helps create dynamic routes in [next js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
- Add the following lines to `[tokenId].js` file. Read about adding API routes in `next js` [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

  ```js
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    // get the tokenId from the query params
    const tokenId = req.query.tokenId;
    // As all the images are uploaded on github, we can extract the images from github directly.
    const image_url =
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnWeb3DAO/NFT-Collection/main/my-app/public/cryptodevs/";
    // The api is sending back metadata for a Crypto Dev
    // To make our collection compatible with Opensea, we need to follow some Metadata standards
    // when sending back the response from the api
    // More info can be found here: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards
    res.status(200).json({
      name: "Crypto Dev #" + tokenId,
      description: "Crypto Dev is a collection of developers in crypto",
      image: image_url + tokenId + ".svg",
    });
  }
  ```

- Now you have an api route which `Opensea` can call to retrieve the metadata for the NFT

- Lets deploy a new `Crypto Devs` contract with this new api route as your `METADATA_URL`

- Open your `hardhat-tutorial/constants` folder and inside your `index.js` file, replace "https://nft-collection-sneh1999.vercel.app/api/" with the domain which you saved to notepad and add "/api/" to its end.

- Save the file and open up a new terminal pointing to `hardhat-tutorial` folder and deploy a new contract
  ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
  ```
- Save the new NFT contract address to a notepad.

- Open up "my-app/constants" folder and inside the `index.js` file replace the old NFT contract address with the new one

- Push all the code to github and wait for vercel to deploy the new code.

- After vercel has deployed your code, open up your website and mint an NFT

- After your transaction gets successful,In your browser open up this link by replacing `your-nft-contract-address` with the address of your NFT contract (https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/your-nft-contract-address/1)

- Your NFT is now available on Opensea ðŸš€ ðŸ¥³

- Share your Opensea link with everyone on discord :) and spread happiness.
